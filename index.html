            <p>The key to good health is good nutrition, so Healthy Food Guide (HFG) is your complete guide to healthy eating and getting the best nutrition. We don’t believe in diets. We do believe in healthy eating every day. There are many ways to achieve this, and different approaches work for different people. Changes to healthier eating should be practical, enjoyable and sustainable, not restrictive and unsociable.</p>
